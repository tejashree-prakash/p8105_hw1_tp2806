``` r
#Problem 1: Get size of the dataset
rows <- nrow(early_january_weather)
col <- ncol(early_january_weather)
mean_temp <- mean(early_january_weather$temp)
```

The early_january_weather dataset contains 358 rows and 15 columns of
hourly weather data collected during early January. The variables
included in this dataset are day, dewp, hour, humid, month, origin,
precip, pressure, temp, time_hour, visib, wind_dir, wind_gust,
wind_speed, year.

Important variables include:

- `temp`: temperature in °F, the mean temperature is 39.5821229 °F.

- `humid`: relative humidity (%)

``` r
#Problem 1: Make scatter plot. 
weather_scplot <- ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y=temp, colour = humid)) + geom_point()
weather_scplot
```

``` r
#Save plot. 
ggsave("weather_scatterplot.png", plot = weather_scplot, width = 6, height = 4, dpi = 300)
```

The scatter plot demonstrates a general upward shift, when relating time
by hour (x) against temperature (y). This means that, on average, as the
time passes, the temperature increases. Additionally, the later times
have a greater humidity level than compared to the earlier times in this
dataset.

``` r
#Problem 2: Create df. 
randomdf = tibble(
  numeric_samp = rnorm(10, mean = 1), #random sample of size 10, mean 1 
  greater_0 = numeric_samp > 0, #logical vector to indicate whether > 0 (TRUE/FALSE)
  char_vector = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),#character vector of length 10
  factor_vector = factor(
    sample(c("low","medium","high"), size = 10, replace = TRUE), #create three levels 
    levels = c("low","medium","high")
))
print(randomdf)
```

``` r
#Perform means for different variables
mean_numeric <- mean(randomdf$numeric_samp)
mean_logic <- mean(randomdf$greater_0)
mean_char <- mean(randomdf$char_vector)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(randomdf$char_vector): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_factor <- mean(randomdf$factor_vector)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(randomdf$factor_vector): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

If I take the mean of my numeric vector of 10 random values, I get
1.5572835. If I take the mean of the logic variable, I get 1, which is
the proportion of values greater than 0. However, if I take the mean of
the remaining two variables, the character and factor variables, I
return NA. This is because these variables do not contain numeric
values, and therefore I cannot obtain a mean.

``` r
# Convert each variable type to numeric 
greater_0 <- as.numeric(randomdf$greater_0)
mean_logic <- mean(greater_0) %>% print()

char_vector <- as.numeric(randomdf$char_vector)   
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
mean_char <- mean(char_vector) %>% print()

factor_vector <- as.numeric(randomdf$factor_vector)
mean_factor <- mean(factor_vector) %>% print()
```

If I force these variables to a numeric class, it mostly works. The
logic variable still results in the same mean, which demonstrates that
logic variables can work to produce a mean without being converted to
numeric. For the factor variable, I am able to change it to numeric and
then obtain a mean - which is the mean of underlying level, low = 1,
medium = 2, high = 3 . However, a character variable cannot be converted
to numeric unless I map it out to be numeric. For example, I’d have to
state that a = 1, b = 2, etc.
